# Vanity Number Encoder
A program written in C that encodes/decodes vanity phone numbers.

Example (Decoding):
123-EGG-EGGS would be decoded into its numeric form by mapping each letter to its corresponding number.

Example (Encoding):
123-456-7890 would generate every possible vanity number that could be made using that phone number.
Encoding has the option of outputting to the console or a file (dashes can also be added or removed).
